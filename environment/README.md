# Training environment

The wis2box portable training environment consists of the following components:
- One (1) Nighthawk Wi-Fi router
- Three (3) ZOTAX ZBOX Mini PCs (M Series Edge MI623)

Each ZOTAX ZBOX Mini PC has been fitted with:
- 64 GB Memory
- 2 TB SSD

The ZOTAX ZBOX Mini PCs are running virtualization software: ProxMox version 7.3.

The 3 PCs together are setup in a ProxMox cluster to provide VMs for participants during the training.

The Nighthawk is setup to broadcast a password-protected Wi-Fi network with SSID **WIS2-training**.
The local network is defined by 10.0.0.1/22

Adminstrators can access training environment from the following locations:

- Nighthawk Wi-Fi router interface at https://10.0.0.1
- ProxMox cluster interface at https://10.0.1.1:8006

Each VM host has a 'vm-clone-base' template from which new VMs can be created.

The 'vm-clone-base' template consists of:

- 2 vCPUs
- 48 GB local storage
- 4 GB RAM
- Ubuntu 22.0.4 LTS with the following system packages installed:
    - Docker CE v2.21.0
    - docker compose 24.0.6
    - packages installed via `pip3`:
      - minio
      - pywis-pubsub
      - pywiscat

### VM naming convention

ProxMox hosts running on mini PCs:

- vm-host-1: 10.0.1.1
- vm-host-2: 10.0.2.1
- vm-host-3: 10.0.3.1

Student VMs:

- on vm-host-1: 10.0.1.11, 10.0.1.12, 10.0.1.13 etc.
- on vm-host-2: 10.0.2.11, 10.0.2.12, 10.0.2.13 etc.
- on vm-host-2: 10.0.3.11, 10.0.3.12, 10.0.3.13 etc.

### student VM setup

Student VMs can be setup by cloning the a base template.

The script `setup_student_vm.sh` can be used to by the `wmo_admin` account to create a new user account on the student VM and add the latest wis2box release to the home directory of the new user along with the exercise materials.

The WiFi router has pre-configured mac-to-IP settings. After cloning the base template set the MAC address to match the IP using the following logic:

- `00:00:00:00:01:11` -> `10.0.1.11`
- `00:00:00:00:02:12` -> `10.0.2.12`
- etc.

### local DNS

A local DNS-server is setup on a VM with IP 10.0.2.111. 

DNS server UI
http://dns-server.wis2.training:5380/
or
http://10.0.2.111:5380/

The DNS server UI can be used to check the status of the DNS-server and/or to add additional A-records. The DNS server is preconfigured with A-records naming each host for each local training participants. 

The DNS-server is hosted on a VM on vm-host-2. If vm-host-2 is lost during transit or broken a backup is available on vm-host-1. If the DNS-server for some reason does not work at all, participants can just use the IP as hostname.
