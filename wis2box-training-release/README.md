wis2box-training
================

This is a copy of wis2box-1.0b1, in which all images are pulled from docker-hub, to allow us to the docker-registry-mirror during WIS2-training.

It includes test-data for Malawi to setup wis2box with pre-configured data.

Please see https://docs.wis2box.wis.wmo.int/en/latest/user/setup.html for setting up wis2box from example configurations in this directory.
