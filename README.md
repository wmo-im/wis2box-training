# wis2box-training

Repository containing wis2box training material (exercises, data, configuration).

## Environment

The `environment` directory provides documentation and materials used to run the local setup.

The wis2box training is designed to be run on a local network containing all data, images and configurations.

A set of hardware (Wi-Fi router and 3 mini PCs) is brought along to local training sessions. The hardware setup will provide a dedicate student VM with Ubuntu and docker to each participant.

A local registry mirroring Docker Hub is setup on the local hardware to reduce the time needed to download large Docker images in a low bandwidth environment.

## Exercise materials

All the contents of the `exercise-materials` directory are added to the gh-pages during deployment in a single zipfile `exercise-materials.zip`.

The practical sessions will start by asking the student to download this archive on their local machine and extracting it.

## Building the workshop content locally

The workshop manual is powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) which facilitates easy management
and publishing of documentation.  Workshop content is written in Markdown.

### Setting up the manual environment locally

# build a virtual Python environment in isolation
python3 -m venv .
