# WIS2 in a box training

WIS2 in a box ([wis2box](https://docs.wis2box.wis.wmo.int)) is a Free and Open Source (FOSS) Reference Implementation of a WMO WIS2 Node. The project provides a plug and play toolset to ingest, process, and publish weather/climate/water data using standards-based approaches in alignment with the WIS2 principles. wis2box also provides access to all data in the WIS2 network. wis2box is designed to have a low barrier to entry for data providers, providing enabling infrastructure and services for data discovery, access, and visualization.

This training provides step-by-step explanations of various aspects of the wis2box project as well as a number of exercises
to help you publish and download data from WIS2.  The training is provided in the form of overview presentations as well as
hands-on practical exercises.

Participants will be able to work with sample test data and metadata, as well as integrate their own data and metadata.

This training covers a wide range of topics (install/setup/configuration, publishing/downloading data, etc.). 

## Goals and learning outcomes

The goals of this training are to become familiar with the following:

- WIS2 architecture core concepts and components
- data and metadata formats used in WIS2 for discovery and access
- wis2box architecture and environment
- wis2box core functions:
    - metadata management
    - data ingest and transformation to BUFR format
    - MQTT broker for WIS2 message publishing
    - HTTP endpoint for data download
    - API endpoint for programmatic access to data
