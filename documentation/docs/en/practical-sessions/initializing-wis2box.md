#  Initializing wis2box

!!! abstract "Learning outcomes"

    By the end of this practical session, you will be able to:

    - run the `wis2box-create-config.py` script to create the initial configuration
    - start wis2box and check the status of its components
    - view the contents of the **wis2box-api**
    - access the **wis2box-webapp**
    - connect to the local **wis2box-broker** using MQTT Explorer

!!! note

    The current training materials are based on wis2box-release 1.0.0. 
    
    See [accessing-your-student-vm](./accessing-your-student-vm.md) for instructions on how to download and install the wis2box software stack if you are running this training outside of a local training session.

## Preparation

Login to your designated VM with your username and password and ensure you are in the `wis2box` directory:

```bash
cd ~/wis2box
```

## Creating the initial configuration

The initial configuration for the wis2box requires:

- an environment file `wis2box.env` containing the configuration parameters
- a directory on the host-machine to share between the host machine and the wis2box containers defined by the `WIS2BOX_HOST_DATADIR` environment variable

The `wis2box-create-config.py` script can be used to create the initial configuration of your wis2box. 

It will ask you a set of question to help setup your configuration.

You will be able to review and update the configuration files after the script has completed.

Run the script as follows:

```bash
python3 wis2box-create-config.py
```

### wis2box-host-data directory

The script will ask you to enter the directory to be used for the `WIS2BOX_HOST_DATADIR` environment variable.

Note that you need to define the full path to this directory.

For example if your username is `username`, the full path to the directory is `/home/username/wis2box-data`:

```{.copy}
username@student-vm-username:~/wis2box$ python3 wis2box-create-config.py
Please enter the directory to be used for WIS2BOX_HOST_DATADIR:
/home/username/wis2box-data
The directory to be used for WIS2BOX_HOST_DATADIR will be set to:
    /home/username/wis2box-data
Is this correct? (y/n/exit)
y
The directory /home/username/wis2box-data has been created.
```

### wis2box URL

Next, you will be asked to enter the URL for your wis2box. This is the URL that will be used to access the wis2box web application, API and UI.

Please use `http://<your-hostname-or-ip>` as the URL.

```{.copy}
Please enter the URL of the wis2box:
 For local testing the URL is http://localhost
 To enable remote access, the URL should point to the public IP address or domain name of the server hosting the wis2box.
http://username.wis2.training
The URL of the wis2box will be set to:
  http://username.wis2.training
Is this correct? (y/n/exit)
```

### WEBAPP, STORAGE and BROKER passwords

You can use the option of random password generation when prompted for and `WIS2BOX_WEBAPP_PASSWORD`, `WIS2BOX_STORAGE_PASSWORD`, `WIS2BOX_BROKER_PASSWORD` and define your own.

Don't worry about remembering these passwords, they will be stored in the `wis2box.env` file in your wis2box-directory.

### Review `wis2box.env`

Once the scripts is completed check the contents of the `wis2box.env` file in your current directory:

```bash
cat ~/wis2box/wis2box.env
```

Or check the content of the file via WinSCP.

!!! question

    What is the value of WISBOX_BASEMAP_URL in the wis2box.env file?

??? success "Click to reveal answer"

    The default value for WIS2BOX_BASEMAP_URL is `https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`.

    This URL refers to the OpenStreetMap tile server. If you want to use a different map provider, you can change this URL to point to a different tile server.

!!! question 

    What is the value of the WIS2BOX_STORAGE_DATA_RETENTION_DAYS environment variable in the wis2box.env file?

??? success "Click to reveal answer"

    The default value for WIS2BOX_STORAGE_DATA_RETENTION_DAYS is 30 days. You can change this value to a different number of days if you wish.
    
    The wis2box-management container runs a cronjob on a daily basis to remove data older than the number of days defined by WIS2BOX_STORAGE_DATA_RETENTION_DAYS from the `wis2box-public` bucket and the API backend:
    
    ```{.copy}
    0 0 * * * su wis2box -c "wis2box data clean --days=$WIS2BOX_STORAGE_DATA_RETENTION_DAYS"
    ```

!!! note

    The `wis2box.env` file contains environment variables defining the configuration of your wis2box. For more information consult the [wis2box-documentation](https://docs.wis2box.wis.wmo.int/en/latest/reference/configuration.html).

    Do not edit the `wis2box.env` file unless you are sure of the changes you are making. Incorrect changes can cause your wis2box to stop working.

    Do not share the contents of your `wis2box.env` file with anyone, as it contains sensitive information such as passwords.

## Start wis2box

Ensure you are in the directory containing the wis2box software stack definition files:

```{.copy}
cd ~/wis2box
```

Start wis2box with the following command:

```{.copy}
python3 wis2box-ctl.py start
```

When running this command for the first time, you will see the following output:

```
No docker-compose.images-*.yml files found, creating one
Current version=Undefined, latest version=1.0.0
Would you like to update ? (y/n/exit)
```

Select ``y`` and the the script will create the file ``docker-compose.images-1.0.0.yml``, download the required Docker images and start the services.

Downloading the images may take some time depending on your internet connection speed. This step is only required the first time you start wis2box.

Inspect the status with the following command:

```{.copy}
python3 wis2box-ctl.py status
```

Repeat this command until all services are up and running.

!!! note "wis2box and Docker"
    wis2box runs as a set of Docker containers managed by docker-compose.
    
    The services are defined in the various `docker-compose*.yml` which can be found in the `~/wis2box/` directory.
    
    The Python script `wis2box-ctl.py` is used to run the underlying Docker Compose commands that control the wis2box services.

    You don't need to know the details of the Docker containers to run the wis2box software stack, but you can inspect the `docker-compose*.yml` and files to see how the services are defined. If you are interested in learning more about Docker, you can find more information in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).

To login to the wis2box-management container, use the following command:

```{.copy}
python3 wis2box-ctl.py login
```

Inside the wis2box-management container you can run various commands to manage your wis2box, such as:

- `wis2box auth add-token --path processes/wis2box` : to create an authorization token for the `processes/wis2box` endpoint
- `wis2box data clean --days=<number-of-days>` : to clean up data older than a certain number of days from the `wis2box-public` bucket

To exit the container and go back to the host machine, use the following command:

```{.copy}
exit
```

Run the following command to see the docker containers running on your host machine:

```{.copy}
docker ps
```

You should see the following containers running:

- wis2box-management
- wis2box-api
- wis2box-minio
- wis2box-webapp
- wis2box-auth
- wis2box-ui
- wis2downloader
- elasticsearch
- elasticsearch-exporter
- nginx
- mosquitto
- prometheus
- grafana
- loki

These containers are part of the wis2box software stack and provide the various services required to run the wis2box.

Run the following command to see the docker volumes running on your host machine:

```{.copy}
docker volume ls
```

You should see the following volumes:

- wis2box_project_auth-data
- wis2box_project_es-data
- wis2box_project_htpasswd
- wis2box_project_minio-data
- wis2box_project_prometheus-data
- wis2box_project_loki-data
- wis2box_project_mosquitto-config

As well as some anonymous volumes used by the various containers.

The volumes starting with `wis2box_project_` are used to store persistent data for the various services in the wis2box software stack.

## wis2box API

The wis2box contains an API (Application Programming Interface) that provide data access and processes for interactive visualization, data transformation and publication.

Open a new tab and navigate to the page `http://YOUR-HOST/oapi`.

<img alt="wis2box-api.png" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-api.png" width="800">

This is the landing page of the wis2box API (running via the **wis2box-api** container).

!!! question
     
     What collections are currently available?

??? success "Click to reveal answer"
    
    To view collections currently available through the API, click `View the collections in this service`:

    <img alt="wis2box-api-collections.png" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-api-collections.png" width="600">

    The following collections are currently available:

    - Stations
    - Data notifications
    - Discovery metadata


!!! question

    How many data notifications have been published?

??? success "Click to reveal answer"

    Click on "Data notifications", then click on `Browse through the items of "Data Notifications"`. 
    
    You will note that the page says "No items" as no Data notifications have been published yet.

## wis2box webapp

Open a web browser and visit the page `http://YOUR-HOST/wis2box-webapp`.

You will see a pop-up asking for your username and password. Use the default username `wis2box-user` and the `WIS2BOX_WEBAPP_PASSWORD` defined in the `wis2box.env` file and click "Sign in":

!!! note 

    Check you wis2box.env for the value of your WIS2BOX_WEBAPP_PASSWORD. You can use the following command to check the value of this environment variable:

    ```{.copy}
    cat ~/wis2box/wis2box.env | grep WIS2BOX_WEBAPP_PASSWORD
    ```

Once logged in, you move your mouse to the menu on the left to see the options available in the wis2box web application:

<img alt="wis2box-webapp-menu.png" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-webapp-menu.png" width="400">

This is the wis2box web application to enable you to interact with your wis2box:

- create and manage datasets
- update/review your station metadata
- upload manual observations using FM-12 synop form 
- monitor notifications published on your wis2box-broker

We will use this web application in a later session.

## wis2box-broker

Open the MQTT Explorer on your computer and prepare a new connection to connect to your broker (running via the **wis2box-broker** container).

Click `+` to add a new connection:

<img alt="mqtt-explorer-new-connection.png" src="../../assets/img/mqtt-explorer-new-connection.png" width="300">

You can click on the 'ADVANCED' button and verify you have subscriptions to the the following topics:

- `#`
- `$SYS/#`

<img alt="mqtt-explorer-topics.png" src="../../assets/img/mqtt-explorer-topics.png" width="550">

!!! note

    The `#` topic is a wildcard subscription that will subscribe to all topics published on the broker.

    The messages published under the `$SYS` topic are system messages published by the mosquitto service itself.

Use the following connection details, making sure to replace the value of `<your-host>` with your hostname and `<WIS2BOX_BROKER_PASSWORD>` with the value from your `wis2box.env` file:

- **Protocol: mqtt://**
- **Host: `<your-host>`**
- **Port: 1883**
- **Username: wis2box**
- **Password: `<WIS2BOX_BROKER_PASSWORD>`**

!!! note 

    You can check your wis2box.env for the value of your WIS2BOX_BROKER_PASSWORD. You can use the following command to check the value of this environment variable:

    ```{.copy}
    cat ~/wis2box/wis2box.env | grep WIS2BOX_BROKER_PASSWORD
    ```

    Note that this your **internal** broker password, the Global Broker will use different (read-only) credentials to subscribe to your broker. Never share this password with anyone.

Make sure to click "SAVE" to store your connection details.

Then click "CONNECT" to connect to your **wis2box-broker**.

<img alt="mqtt-explorer-wis2box-broker.png" src="../../assets/img/mqtt-explorer-wis2box-broker.png" width="600">

Once you are connected, verify that your the internal mosquitto statistics being published by your broker under the `$SYS` topic:

<img alt="mqtt-explorer-sys-topic.png" src="../../assets/img/mqtt-explorer-sys-topic.png" width="400">

Keep the MQTT Explorer open, as we will use it to monitor the messages published on the broker.
