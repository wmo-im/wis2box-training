# Adding GTS headers to WIS2 notifications

!!! abstract "Learning outcomes"

    By the end of this practical session, you will be able to:
    
    - configure a mapping between filename and GTS headers
    - ingest data with a filename that matches the GTS headers
    - view the GTS headers in the WIS2 notifications

## Introduction

Why would you want to add GTS-headers to your WIS2 notifications? By adding the GTS-headers to your WIS2-notifications, you can ensure that the data is still available to the GTS users via the WIS2-to-GTS gateway.

Members having migrated to using a WIS2 node for data publication can disable their MSS system and their data would still be available to Members not yet migrated to WIS2.
