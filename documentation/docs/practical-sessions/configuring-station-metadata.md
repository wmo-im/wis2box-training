# Configuring station metadata

!!! abstract "Learning outcomes"

    By the end of this practical session, you will be able to:

    - create an authorization token for the `collections/stations` endpoint
    - add station metadata to wis2box
    - review stations associated to datasets in the **wis2box-ui**
    - update/delete station metadata using the **wis2box-webapp**

## Introduction

wis2box has a collection of station metadata that is used to publish data on WIS2.
Only data for stations configured in the wis2box station list will be published on your wis2box broker.
The **WIGOS Station Identifier (WSI)** is used as the unique reference of the station which produced a specific set of observation data.

## Create an authorization token for collections/stations

To edit stations via the **wis2box-webapp** you will first to need create an authorization token.

Login to your student VM and ensure you are in the `wis2box-1.0b5` directory:

```bash
cd ~/wis2box-1.0b5
```

Then login into the **wis2box-management** container with the following command:

```bash
python3 wis2box-ctl.py login
```

Within the **wis2box-management** container your can create an authorization token for a specific endpoint using the command: `wis2box auth add-token --path <my-endpoint>`.

For example, to use a random automatically generated token for the `collections/stations` endpoint:

```{.copy}
wis2box auth add-token --path collections/stations
```	

The output will look like this:

```{.copy}
Continue with token: 7ca20386a131f0de384e6ffa288eb1ae385364b3694e47e3b451598c82e899d1 [y/N]? y
Token successfully created
```

Or, if you want to define your own token for the `collections/stations` endpoint, you can use the following example:

```{.copy}
wis2box auth add-token --path collections/stations MyCatIsCalledJessie!
```

Output:
    
```{.copy}
Continue with token: MyCatIsCalledJessie! [y/N]? y
Token successfully created
```

!!! note "Exercise 1: Create an authorization token for collections/stations"

    Please create an authorization token for the `collections/stations` endpoint using the instructions above.

## add station metadata using the **wis2box-webapp**

The **wis2box-webapp** provides a graphical user interface to edit station metadata.

Open the **wis2box-webapp** in your browser by navigating to `http://<your-host>/wis2box-app`:

<img alt="wis2box-webapp" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-webapp.png" width="800">

And select stations:

<img alt="wis2box-webapp-select-stations" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-webapp-select-stations.png" width="250">

When you click add 'add new station' you are asked to provide the WIGOS-station-identifier for the station you want to add:

<img alt="wis2box-webapp-import-station-from-oscar" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-webapp-import-station-from-oscar.png" width="800">

When you click search the station data is retrieved from OSCAR/Surface, please note that this can take a few seconds.

Review the data returned by OSCAR/Surface and add missing data where required. Select a topic for the station and provide your authorization token for the `collections/stations` endpoint and click 'save':

<img alt="wis2box-webapp-create-station-save" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-webapp-create-station-save.png" width="800">

<img alt="wis2box-webapp-create-station-success" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-webapp-create-station-success.png" width="500">

Go back to the station list and you will see the station you added:

<img alt="wis2box-webapp-stations-with-one-station" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-webapp-stations-with-one-station.png" width="800">

!!! note "Exercise 2: Add station metadata"

    Please add three or more stations to the wis2box station metadata collection of your wis2box. 
    
    Please use stations from your country if possible, especially if you brought your own data.
    
    Otherwise, you can use the following WIGOS-station-identifiers for testing purposes:

    - 0-20000-0-91334
    - 0-20000-0-96323 (note missing station elevation in OSCAR)
    - 0-20000-0-96749 (note missing station elevation in OSCAR)

!!! note "Deriving elevation information"

If your station elevation is missing, there are online services that allow the lookup of the elevation using open elevation data. One such example is the [Open Topo Data API](https://www.opentopodata.org).

For example, to get the elevation of the BMKG auditorium one would query the Open Topo Data API as follows:

```bash
 wget -q -O - "https://api.opentopodata.org/v1/aster30m?locations=-6.15558,106.84204"
{
  "results": [
    {
      "dataset": "aster30m", 
      "elevation": 7.0, 
      "location": {
        "lat": -6.15558, 
        "lng": 106.84204
      }
    }
  ], 
  "status": "OK"
}
```

## Review your station metadata

After saving your station metadata, you can review the content of your station metadata in the **wis2box-webapp**:

You can verify the updated stations are available in the **wis2box-api**:

<img alt="wis2box-api-stations" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-api-stations.png" width="800">

You can also visit the **wis2box-ui** at `http://<your-host>` and select "EXPLORE" on your dataset and you will see the stations you added:

<img alt="wis2box-ui-explore-stations" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-ui-explore-stations.png" width="800">

!!! note "Exercise 3: Review your station metadata"

    Verify the stations you added are associated to your dataset by visiting the **wis2box-api** and **wis2box-ui** endpoints for your host in your browser.

You also have the option to view/update/delete the station in the **wis2box-webapp**. Note that you are required to provide your authorization token for the `collections/stations` endpoint to update/delete the station.

!!! note "Exercise 4: Update/delete station metadata"

    Please update/delete the station metadata for one of the stations you added using the **wis2box-webapp**.

## Conclusion

!!! success "Congratulations!"
    In this practical session, you learned how to:

    - create an authorization token for the `collections/stations` endpoint
    - add station metadata to wis2box
    - review stations associated to datasets in the **wis2box-ui**
    - update/delete station metadata using the **wis2box-webapp**
