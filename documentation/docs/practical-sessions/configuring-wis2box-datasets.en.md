# Configuring datasets in wis2box

!!! abstract "Learning outcomes"
    By the end of this practical session, you will be able to:

    - create a new dataset
    - create discovery metadata for a dataset
    - configure data mappings for a dataset
    - publish a WIS2 notification with a WCMP2 record
    - update and re-publish your dataset

## Introduction

wis2box uses datasets that are associated with discovery metadata and data mappings.

Discovery metadata is used to create a WCMP2 (WMO Core Metadata Profile 2) record that is shared using a WIS2 notification published on your wis2box-broker.

The data mappings are used to associate a data plugin to your input data, allowing your data to be transformed prior to being published using the WIS2 notification.

This session will walk you through creating a new dataset, creating discovery metadata, and configuring data mappings. You will inspect your dataset in the wis2box-api and review the WIS2 notification for your discovery metadata.

## Preparation

Connect to your broker using MQTT Explorer. 

Instead of using your internal broker credentials, use the public credentials `everyone/everyone`:

<img alt="MQTT Explorer: Connect to broker" src="../../assets/img/mqtt-explorer-wis2box-broker-everyone-everyone.png" width="800">

!!! Note

    You never need to share the credentials of your internal broker with external users. The 'everyone' user is a public user to enable sharing of WIS2 notifications.

    The `everyone/everyone` credentials has read-only access on the topic 'origin/a/wis2/#'. This is the topic where the WIS2 notifications are published. The Global Broker can subscribe with these public credentials to receive the notifications.
    
    The 'everyone' user will not see internal topics or be able to publish messages.
    
Open a browser and open a page to `http://<your-host>/wis2box-webapp`. Make sure you are logged in and can access the 'dataset editor' page.

See the section on [Initializing wis2box](/practical-sessions/initializing-wis2box) if you need to remember how to connect to the broker or access the wis2box-webapp.

## Create an authorization token for processes/wis2box

You will need an authorization token for the 'processes/wis2box' endpoint to publish your dataset. 

To create an authorization token, access your training VM over SSH and use the following commands to login to the wis2box-management container:

```bash
cd ~/wis2box-1.0.0rc1
python3 wis2box-ctl.py login
```

Then run the following command to create a randomly generated authorization token for the 'processes/wis2box' endpoint:

```bash
wis2box auth add-token --path processes/wis2box
```

You can also create a token with a specific value by providing the token as an argument to the command:

```bash
wis2box auth add-token --path processes/wis2box MyS3cretToken
```

Make sure to copy the token value and store it on your local machine, as you will need it later.

Once you have your token, you can exit the wis2box-management container:

```bash
exit
```

## Creating a new dataset in the wis2box-webapp

Navigate to the 'dataset editor' page in the wis2box-webapp of your wis2box instance by going to `http://<your-host>/wis2box-webapp` and selecting 'dataset editor' from the menu on the left hand side.

On the 'dataset editor' page, under the 'Datasets' tab, click on "Create New ...":

<img alt="Create New Dataset" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-create-new-dataset.png" width="800">

A pop-up window will appear, asking you to provide:

- **Centre ID** : this is the agency acronym (in lower case and no spaces), as specified by the WMO Member, that identifies the data centre responsible for publishing the data.
- **Data Type**: The type of data you are creating metadata for. You can choose between using a predefined template or selecting 'other'.  If 'other' is selected, more fields will have to be manually filled. 

!!! Note "Centre ID"

    Your centre-id should start with the TLD of your country, followed by a dash (`-`) and an abbreviated name of your organization (for example `fr-meteofrance`). The centre-id must be lowercase and use alphanumeric characters only. The dropdown list shows all currently registered centre-ids on WIS2 as well as any centre-id you have already created in wis2box.

!!! Note "Data Type Templates"

    The *Data Type* field allows you to select from a list of templates available in the wis2box-webapp dataset editor. A template will pre-populate the form with suggested default values appropriate for the data type. This includes suggested title and keywords for the metadata and pre-configured data plugins. The topic will be fixed to the default topic for the data type.

    For the purpose of the training we will use the *weather/surface-based-observations/synop* data type which includes data plugins that ensure the data is transformed into BUFR format before being published.

    If you want to publish CAP alerts using wis2box, use the template *weather/advisories-warnings*. This template includes a data plugin that verifies the input data is a valid CAP alert before publishing. To create CAP alerts and publish them via wis2box you can use [CAP Composer](https://github.com/wmo-raf/cap-composer).

Please choose a centre-id appropriate for your organization.

For **Data Type**, select **weather/surface-based-observations/synop**:

<img alt="Create New Dataset Form: Initial information" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-create-new-dataset-form-initial.png" width="450">

Click *continue to form* to proceed, you will now be presented with the **Dataset Editor Form**.

Since you selected the **weather/surface-based-observations/synop** data type, the form will be pre-populated with some initial values related to this data type.

## Creating discovery metadata

The Dataset Editor Form allows you to provide the Discovery Metadata for your dataset that the wis2box-management container will use to publish a WCMP2 record.

Since you have selected the 'weather/surface-based-observations/synop' data type, the form will be pre-populated with some default values.

Please make sure to replace the auto-generated 'Local ID' with a descriptive name for your dataset, e.g. 'synop-dataset-wis2training':

<img alt="Metadata Editor: title, description, keywords" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-metadata-editor-part1.png" width="800">

Review the title and keywords, and update them as necessary, and provide a description for your dataset.

Note there are options to change the 'WMO Data Policy' from 'core' to 'recommended' or to modify your default Metadata Identifier, please keep data-policy as 'core' and use the default Metadata Identifier.

Next, review the section defining your 'Temporal Properties' and 'Spatial Properties'. You can adjust the bounding box by updating the 'North Latitude', 'South Latitude', 'East Longitude', and 'West Longitude' fields:

<img alt="Metadata Editor: temporal properties, spatial properties" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-metadata-editor-part2.png" width="800">

Next, fill out the section defining the 'Contact Information of the Data Provider':

<img alt="Metadata Editor: contact information" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-metadata-editor-part3.png" width="800">

Finally, fill out the section defining the 'Data Quality Information':

Once you are done filling out all the sections, click 'VALIDATE FORM' and check the form for any errors:

<img alt="Metadata Editor: validation" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-metadata-validation-error.png" width="800">

If there are any errors, correct them and click 'VALIDATE FORM' again.

Making sure you have no errors and that you get a pop-up indication your form has been validated:

<img alt="Metadata Editor: validation success" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-metadata-validation-success.png" width="800">

Next, before submitting your dataset, review the data mappings for your dataset.

## Configuring data mappings

Since you used a template to create your dataset, the dataset mappings have been pre-populated with the defaults plugins for the 'weather/surface-based-observations/synop' data type. Data plugins are used in the wis2box to transform data before it is published using the WIS2 notification.

<img alt="Data Mappings: update plugin" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-data-mappings.png" width="800">

Note that you can click on the "update"-button to change settings for the plugin such as file-extension and the file-pattern, you can leave the default settings for now. In a later session, you will learn more about BUFR and the transformation of data into BUFR format.

## Submitting your dataset

Finally, you can click 'submit' to publish your dataset. 

You will need to provide the authorization token for 'processes/wis2box' that you created earlier. If you have not done so, you can create a new token by following the instructions in the preparation section.

Check that you get the following message after submitting your dataset, indicating that the dataset was successfully submitted:

<img alt="Submit Dataset Success" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-submit-dataset-success.png" width="400">

After you click 'OK', you are redirected to the Dataset Editor home page. Now if you click on the 'Dataset' tab, you should see your new dataset listed:

<img alt="Dataset Editor: new dataset" src="../../assets/img/wis2box-dataset-editor-new-dataset.png" width="800">

## Reviewing the WIS2-notification for your discovery metadata

Go to MQTT Explorer, if you were connected to the broker, you should see a new WIS2 notification published on the topic `origin/a/wis2/<your-centre-id>/metadata`:

<img alt="MQTT Explorer: WIS2 notification" src="../../assets/img/mqtt-explorer-wis2-notification-metadata.png" width="800">

Inspect the content of the WIS2 notification you published. You should see a JSON with a structure corresponding to the WIS Notification Message (WNM) format.

!!! question

    On what topic is the WIS2 notification published?

??? success "Click to reveal answer"

    The WIS2 notification is published on the topic `origin/a/wis2/<your-centre-id>/metadata`.

!!! question
    
    Try to find the title, description and keywords you provided in the discovery metadata in the WIS2 notification.  Can you find them?

??? success "Click to reveal answer"

    Note that the title, description, and keywords you provided in the discovery metadata are **not** present in the WIS2 notification payload! 
    
    Instead, try to look for the canonical link  in the "links"-section in the WIS2 notification:

    <img alt="WIS2 notification for metadata, links sections" src="../../assets/img/wis2-notification-metadata-links.png" width="800">

    The WIS2 notification contains a canonical link to the WCMP2 record that was published. If you copy-paste this link into a browser, you will download the WCMP2 record and see the title, description, and keywords you provided.

## Conclusion

!!! success "Congratulations!"
    In this practical session, you learned how to:

    - create a new dataset
    - define your discovery metadata
    - review your data mappings
    - publish discovery metadata
    - review the WIS2 notification for your discovery metadata
