## Overview

Docker allows for creating virtual envronments in an isolated manner in support
of virtualization of computing resources.  The basic concept behind Docker is containerization,
where software can run as services, interacting with other software containers, for example.

The typical Docker workflow involves creating **images**, which are then run as **containers**.

### Image management

* List available images

```bash
docker images
```

* Build an image from a Dockerfile:

```bash
cat << EOF > Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update 
RUN apt-get install â€“y nginx 

CMD ["echo", "Hello from my first Docker setup!"] 
EOF
```

* Building the image:

```bash
docker build -t my-image:local .
```

* Removing an image:

```bash
docker rmi <image-name>
```

### Volume Management

* List all created volumes:

```bash
docker volume ls
```

* Create a volume:

```bash
docker volume create my-volume
```

* Display detailed information on a volume:

```bash
docker volume inspect my-volume
```

* Remove a volume:

```bash
docker volume rm my-volume
```

* Remove all unused volumes:

```bash
docker volume prune
```

### Container Management

* Create a container from an image, with an interactive terminal (`it`) and a mounted volume (`v`):

```bash
docker run -it -v ${pwd}:/app my-image:local
```

* Display a list of currently running containers:
    
```bash
docker ps
```

* List of all containers:
    
```bash
docker ps -a
```

* Start a container:

```bash
docker start <container_name>
```

* Enter the interactive terminal of a running container:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash
```

* Remove a container 

```bash
docker rm <container_name>
```

* Remove a running container:

```bash
docker rm -f <container_name>
```
